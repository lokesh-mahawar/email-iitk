Oral Examination Notice  Title: 	Liquid Infused Stainless Steel Surfaces for Anti-Biofouling Name:  	Syed Rameez Ahmad (20105149) Date: 	December 30, 2022, 4:00 PM (IST) Place: 	Online Meeting Link: https://iitk-ac-in.zoom.us/j/98856160692?pwd=SyswQzEzQ3J0d1VjdkxXR1c1eGdzZz09 Meeting ID: 988 5616 0692 Passcode: 532217 Anyone interested can join the online presentation on 30th December between 3:50 PM - 4:00 PM. Abstract Biofouling is the growth of microorganisms on the surfaces such as the hulls of ships or bacterial growth on thecatheter’s inner surface and other medical devices etc.In the current study, a liquid infused surface (LIS) is prepared on stainless steel by initially making micro level patterns with grooves of depth around 1µm, followed by chemical functionalization of the surface with Octadecyl Trichloro Silane (OTS) to make it hydrophobic. Subsequently, the silicone oil is used as the lubricating fluid to infusethe grooves using the dip coating technique. The biofouling analysis of the prepared LIS is carried out using static culture medium for a period of 2h, 24h, and 48 h. Staining of the biofilm is done using crystal violet. Upright optical microscope is used to acquire the fluorescent images to study growth of biofilm. It is observed that LIS has excellent self-healing property, non-stickiness towards ketchup, and honey. Biofouling results after 2h, 12h and 24h showed that LIS has superior biofouling performance compared to bare stainless steel surface.    Krishnacharya P. K.
